Sensor MLX90620
---------------------------

 1. It is used an Arduino MEGA for obtaining the data generated by the sensor using the I2C bus.
    
 2. On python a graphic user interface is displaying 64 pixels with the temperature registrated by the sensor.

Files:
--------------
+ GUIMLX90620.py - This is the Python code that is for displaying the data from the sensor in a GUI,it is not made for the ROS enviroment. The corresponding python code for displaying the temperature on ROS is in Kauil_ROS repository.

+ MLX90620 (library)- This library was created for simplifying the main code of the Arduino.
    + MLX90620Serial: This is the Arduino code that is not made for the ROS enviroment, it only obtains the data from the sensor via I2C and sends it to a computer via usb (serial). For displaying the data in the GUI, use the GUIMLX90620.py code which is situated on the Kauil_extras repository.
    
    + MLX90620ROS_Int16Array: This is the Arduino code which was made for interacting with ROS, besides of obtaining the sensor data, it creates a plubisher node. For displaying the data in the GUI use the GUIMLX90620.py code which is situated on the Kauil_ROS repository under MLX90620/src.

Refer to the Arduino [tutorial][1] for adding a new librarie to the IDE.
